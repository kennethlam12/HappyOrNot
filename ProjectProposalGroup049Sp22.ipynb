These world happiness reports, as said by experts in various fields such as economy and national statistics, are used in order to help define the progress of nations along with other things.(1)  This can be seen in the use of well being surveys, a model to measure individual happiness was used in order to rank individual cities conditions.

For example, the association of suicide with another particularly negative topic, unemployment, led to a 2-3 times chance of death from suicide.(3) Using this as a measure of the opposite to the world happiness scale, we should be able to potentially see an effect between the two.\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that countries with lower happiness will have more suicides. This is due to the fact that one of the main causes of suicide is depression and places with lower happiness rates tend to have less happy people. \n",
    "Another reason a country with a lower happiness rate might be more prone to suicides is drug abuse. People may turn to drugs to increase their happiness levels in the short run, but long term use of drugs is linked to suicidal thoughts."
